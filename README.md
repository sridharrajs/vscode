# VSCode

This repo has contains the list of tweaks I did to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Minimap

By default, VSCode shows you `minimap`, to disable it, Click `View` Menu -> Select `Toggle Minimap`

## File pane changes

When you open files(using control click/Side pane), VSCode will load the file on the same pane. You would need to change preview options to load them in different pane. To do, `Code` Menu -> `Preference` -> `Settings`. Search for `Enable preview` and uncheck it.
